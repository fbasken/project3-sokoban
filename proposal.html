        <p>
            I was initially unsure what to create for <b>Project 3</b>. I wanted to avoid making any game
            with 2D physics, as I'd already done games like that before, and I also wanted to avoid spending substantial
            portions of time on level design. While I love designing levels, I only had limited time for this project
            and I knew it would be a challenge to work with PixiJS and JavaScript, as they're both relatively new to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sokoban turned out to be the perfect solution. It was exactly what I wanted for my project and I had a
            decent idea of how I wanted to execute it. Coincidentally, my first introduction to Sokoban was through a
            similar avenue&mdash; a JavaScript rendition of Sokoban by <a href="http://birrell.org/andrew/sokoban/"
                target="_blank">Andrew Birrell</a>. I don't even remember how I stumbled across this but it's definitely
            where I first saw the game and it's where I
            drew a lot of the inspiration for this project. The graphics and overall user experience of Birrell's site,
            clearly a relic of an earlier era of the internet, were something I was motivated to improve on in this
            project, although his implementation has several features that are out of my scope for this project.
        </p>
        <p>
            When creating the interface for a fairly simple game like Sokoban, I put in a lot of work on smaller things,
            details that don't stand out but serve to really polish the user experience. For instance, the level
            input field will resize vertically to fit the text, and then shrink back down after. This also happens when
            you hit the submit button (which visually changes its enabled state based on the input field). Finally, when
            you submit a level into the box, some preliminary checks are made, and the level is discarded if it's
            invalid. For all of this work, what you get is a simple box that behaves how you'd expect it to
            behave&mdash; and that's how I wanted the user to feel when using the site: unencumbered and undistracted by
            the interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            To take this attention to detail a level further: the screen is fully resizable, and the app accounts for
            the difference in the level's aspect ratio and centers the level accordingly. The camera will zoom to match
            this, easing into the target location. I used a PixiJS&nbsp;<code>BlurFilter</code> to add an effect to
            this transition as well. I also added a custom favicon like in my last project, and took the customization
            even further, adding OpenGraph meta tags to the page, visible when the link is pasted somewhere like Slack
            or Discord.
        </p>
        <p>
            One issue I ran into while developing this game was Javascript's lack of real abstract class support, and
            furthermore, lack of support for multiple inheritance. I had to repeat the same sections of code, however it
            was fairly minor. I would definitely choose a different language were I to develop a similar project in the
            future, probably opting to use TypeScript for its strong typing and support for object-oriented patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon nearing completion of this project, I realized what was perhaps the largest flaw in my code: my
            implementation of Sokoban itself. I was so eager to see some results from PixiJS that I just kind of made up
            the logic as I went along. First I thought: OK, so it's a tile based game&mdash; therefore a 2D array would
            be the best way to handle this. Then I realized later that the movement of boxes and the player would be an
            issue here, so I wrote movement in a way that gets around that, and then does a basic "am I still on the
            grid?" check afterward.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was a mistake&mdash; since PixiJS stores each rectangle as its own <code>PIXI.Graphics</code> object, I
            could just work with that. Rendering the game from a 2D array might be a solution I'd use with a
            different framework and/or programming language, but here I could just take every object and give it a row
            and column integer value, and thus ditch the 2D array. This would alleviate the redundancy
            where objects both exist as themselves and as a char in the 2D array. While this change isn't something
            I plan to refactor in, it was an example of something I didn't fully realize and account for, especially
            given my initial lack of understanding PixiJS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I'm quite happy with my finished result. While it lacks extensive quality of life features and
            feature parity to existing Sokoban interfaces, I generally succeeded in setting my scope
            realistically and delivering a polished product in the aspects that I did implement. In the future, I think
            I'll account more for the new user experience, and plan out my design/roadmap ahead of time.

        <p>
            <i>Sōkoban</i>&mdash; the classic Japanese puzzle game where you play as a worker at a box-filled warehouse,
            pushing boxes around to their correct locations. When moving around this orthogonal
            world of crates and walls, make sure you don't block yourself (or the boxes) off!
        </p>
        <div class="columns-container">

                <h2>Genre</h2>
                <p>
                    Top-down block puzzle game.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>

        </div>
        <h2>Aesthetic</h2>
        <p>
            Aesthetically, I'm aiming for something surreal and geometric&mdash; I'm more interested in making something
            appealing and minimalistic, realized with simple outlines, shapes, blurring, and shadows (I don't have a
            dedicated artist to draw detailed sprites, anyway). Since Sokoban is such an abstract, conceptual game,
            there's a lot of freedom with how you choose to graphically represent it.
            I've seen a few takes on it but nothing quite like what I'm imagining for this project.
        </p>

        <p>
            The audio will be unintrustive but supportive and immersive to the experience. Effects will be
            subtle, tactile, and fairly abstract/surreal, mirroring the visual style.
        </p>

        <p>
            See <a id="concept-art-section-link">concept art</a> below. I plan to modify this heavily&mdash;
            this is just a loose idea as to the direction I want to go in. Ultimately, hoping to make this look
            fairly elegant.
        </p>
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            No real story&mdash; it's a pretty abstract game. Many incarnations of Sokoban are loosely tied to a story
            with the warehouse metaphor. In my version, it will simply be the puzzle itself, with zero narrative
            grounding.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lacking an underlying narrative, the player is motivated purely by the puzzle. Figuring things out results
            in that
            "a-ha" moment which is a great source of encouragement for the player.
        </p>
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
            Sokoban has only 1 mechanic, a <i>move</i>, that can be realized in two ways. Either you move onto an empty
            tile, allowing further navigation of the level, or you move into an unobstructed box, pushing it,
            fundamentally changing the layout of the level.
        </p>
        <p>
            The player has only 4 gameplay controls (keyboard cursor keys / WASD), which correspond to the 4
            orthographic directions of movement. There will also be a button to restart the level.
            This encompasses my basic scope for this project, but I
            could additionally add a basic UI and level switching as well if time permits.
        </p>
        <p>
            The player learns to play the game by completing the levels in order. The levels increase in progressive
            difficulty, and through their design the player is implicitly taught the basic concepts of the game. Since
            the penalty for failure is low, even the first levels will seem tough at first.
        </p>
        <p>
            With regards to the levels&mdash; I will create a function that parses a text file into level data. Since
            numerous Sokoban levels already exist in the public domain, converted to textual data, I can simply use
            these. I may also design my some levels of my own, but regardless, level design will not comprise a
            substantial time budget.
        </p>
        <h2>Other</h2>
        <p>
            I will be using PixiJS for the rendering framework and I may use a CSS framework like <a target="_blank"
                href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a>. I'll also be using a GitHub repository for version control and
            centralization of my project.
        </p>

            computer science and software programming, game physics, graphic design, level design, and technology in
            general.
